# Modelling the spread of the corona virus outbreak

A very simple model selection tool to study how well countries are doing with their containment efforts of the COVID-19 outbreak. Based on the data from 

https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

The attached reports show for each country whether the model indicates that the country is on track to containment (logistic curve) or still growing exponentially. For the US, a breakdown by state is available as well.

## The model

The model is based on a simple contagion model looking only at the confirmed cases per country. A formal description of the model is provided in the description paper.
